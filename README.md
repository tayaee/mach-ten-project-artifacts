## Running the Apps

Each app is self-contained with its own dependencies. Navigate to the app's folder and follow the instructions in its README.md.

## Contributing

Apps are organized by category and dated. When adding a new app:

1. Create a new directory following the naming convention: `category/{category}/{YYYY}/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{index}-{app-name}/`
2. Include a `main.py` (or appropriate entry point)
3. Add a `README.md` with the app description, how to build/run, and examples
4. Update this root `README.md` to include the new app
