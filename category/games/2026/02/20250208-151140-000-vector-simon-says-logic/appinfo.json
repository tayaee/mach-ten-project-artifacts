  "description": "Master your memory with a high-speed, logic-driven sequence challenge.",
  "rationale": "Memory games provide a clear baseline for AI agent training in sequential data processing and pattern recognition. This app targets puzzle enthusiasts and developers looking for a clean, logic-heavy environment for reinforcement learning.",
  "details": "The game features a 2x2 grid of distinct colored panels: Red (Top-Left), Blue (Top-Right), Green (Bottom-Left), and Yellow (Bottom-Right). The game begins by flashing a sequence of colors. The user or agent must replicate the sequence exactly. Each round, the sequence length increases by one. If a wrong panel is selected, the game resets. It uses Python with the Pygame library for rendering and event handling. A pyproject.toml file defines dependencies, and uv manages the environment.",
  "how_to_build": "uv sync",
  "how_to_start": "uv run main.py",
  "how_to_stop": "pkill -f main.py",
  "how_to_play": "Observe the light sequence. Use the mouse to click the panels in the exact order shown. Alternatively, use keyboard mapping: Q (Red), W (Blue), A (Green), S (Yellow). Score increases by 10 points for every successfully completed sequence length. The objective is to achieve the highest round count without error.",
