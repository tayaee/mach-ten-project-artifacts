  "description": "Strategic block-pushing puzzle where you crush enemies between ice slides.",
  "rationale": "This game focuses on spatial reasoning and timing. It targets casual puzzle fans and developers interested in grid-based collision logic and simple enemy AI patterns.",
  "details": "The game is a simplified version of the classic arcade game Pengo. The player controls a character in a 13x13 grid filled with ice blocks. The objective is to eliminate all patrolling enemies by pushing ice blocks into them. When a block is pushed, it slides until it hits another block or the screen boundary. Enemies move randomly or follow simple pathfinding. If an enemy is caught between a sliding block and a wall/stationary block, it is destroyed. Blocks can also be destroyed if pushed while already adjacent to a wall.",
