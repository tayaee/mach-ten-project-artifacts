# Gravity Stack Balance

Stack blocks as high as possible on a narrow platform in this physics-based balance game.

## Description

A block-stacking game where blocks move horizontally at the top of the screen. Click to drop blocks onto a narrow platform at the bottom. Blocks respond to physics - they can tilt, slide, and fall if not balanced properly. The game ends when a block falls off the platform.

## Features

- Physics-based block stacking with gravity and collision
- Blocks can rotate and tumble based on impact
- Speed increases with each successfully stacked block
- Rank system from "Beginner" to "Gravity Master"
- High score tracking with local storage
- Colorful blocks with smooth animations

## How to Build

No build process required. HTML5 Canvas with pure JavaScript physics engine.

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## Controls

- Click or Spacebar: Drop the current block

## Examples

- Stack 5 blocks: "Novice Stacker" rank
- Stack 10 blocks: "Stable Builder" rank
- Stack 20 blocks: "Stack Pro" rank
- Stack 30 blocks: "Balance Expert" rank
- Stack 50 blocks: "Gravity Master" rank

As you stack more blocks, the horizontal movement speed increases, making it harder to time your drops accurately. Watch out for blocks tilting off the edge!
