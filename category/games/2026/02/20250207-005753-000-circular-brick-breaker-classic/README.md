# Circular Brick Breaker Classic

A new twist on the classic brick breaker game. Defend from all 360 degrees as balls bounce from the center outward, breaking through circular brick layers.

## Description

A fresh take on brick breaker where you defend 360 degrees instead of just the bottom. The ball spawns from the center and bounces through circular brick layers while you rotate a paddle around the perimeter to keep it in play.

## Features

- 5 layers of circular bricks with different point values
- Inner bricks worth more points (50, 40, 30, 20, 10 from inner to outer)
- Combo system for consecutive brick hits (up to 10x multiplier)
- Progressive difficulty - ball speeds up each level
- Particle effects when bricks are destroyed
- 3 lives to start

## How to Play

1. Click "Start Game"
2. Move your mouse (or touch on mobile) to rotate the paddle around the outer edge
3. Keep the ball inside the play area by blocking it with your paddle
4. Destroy all bricks to advance to the next level
5. Build combos by hitting bricks in quick succession

## Controls
