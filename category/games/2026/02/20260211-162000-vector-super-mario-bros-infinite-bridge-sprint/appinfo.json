  "description": "An endless running challenge where Mario must sprint across a decaying bridge while dodging fireballs and Cheep Cheeps.",
  "rationale": "This game focuses on high-speed reflex testing and resource management (stamina/momentum) in a platforming environment. It serves as an excellent benchmark for reinforcement learning agents to master timing and spatial awareness in a constrained, high-threat area.",
  "details": "The player controls a character on an infinite horizontal bridge. The bridge is composed of segments; some segments disappear shortly after being stepped on (decay). Obstacles include fireballs jumping vertically from the bottom and fish (Cheep Cheeps) jumping in parabolic arcs. The speed of the bridge's progression increases over time. The game ends if the player falls into a gap or touches an enemy/fireball.",
