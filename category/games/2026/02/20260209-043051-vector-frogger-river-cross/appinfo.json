  "description": "Navigate a frog across a busy river by jumping on moving logs and avoiding obstacles.",
  "rationale": "This game focuses on timing and spatial reasoning. It provides a classic arcade challenge that is ideal for testing reinforcement learning agents' ability to predict moving patterns and execute precise movements.",
  "details": "The game consists of a 10x10 grid. The player starts at the bottom row. The middle rows (3 to 7) represent a river with logs moving horizontally at different speeds and directions. The player must jump on logs to cross the river. If the player stays on a log that moves off-screen, or falls into the water (empty space in river rows), the game ends. The top row is the goal area. Once a player reaches the goal, they earn points and reset to the starting position with increased log speeds.",

  "how_to_play": "Use Arrow Keys to move the frog. Move from the bottom row to the top row. Jumping on a log grants 10 points. Reaching the goal row grants 100 points. Game ends if the frog touches water or moves out of bounds while on a log. Score is maximized by reaching the goal as many times as possible within the time limit.",
