  "description": "Navigate deep space and destroy incoming asteroids in this classic arcade shooter.",
  "rationale": "This game focuses on spatial awareness, aiming accuracy, and resource management (ammunition cooldown). It targets fans of classic vector arcade games and provides a clear reward structure for reinforcement learning agents to optimize threat prioritization, positioning, and shooting accuracy in an open 2D environment with wrap-around physics.",
  "details": "A single-player arcade shooter where the player controls a triangular spaceship in deep space. The player must destroy incoming asteroids while avoiding collision. Asteroids break into smaller pieces when shot. The player ship wraps around screen edges for continuous movement. The game features momentum-based physics, thrust controls, and 360-degree rotation. Lives are lost upon collision with asteroids. The game progresses with increasing difficulty as asteroids spawn more frequently at higher levels.",

Scoring: Larger asteroids = 100-350 points, smaller pieces = 100-250 points. The ship wraps around screen edges. Prioritize larger asteroids first as they split into smaller pieces. For RL agents: reward = +10-35 per asteroid size destroyed, -100 per life lost, game ends at 0 lives. Key actions: continuous rotation control, discrete thrust and shoot actions.",
