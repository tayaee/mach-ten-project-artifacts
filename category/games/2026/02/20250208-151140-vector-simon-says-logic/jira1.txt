      error: Multiple top-level modules discovered in a flat-layout: ['config', 'game', 'main', 'test_game'].

      To avoid accidental inclusion of unwanted files or directories,
      setuptools will not proceed with this build.

      If you are trying to create a single distribution with multiple modules
      on purpose, you should not rely on automatic discovery.
      Instead, consider the following options:

      1. set up custom discovery (`find` directive with `include` or `exclude`)
      2. use a `src-layout`
      3. explicitly set `py_modules` or `packages` with a list of names

      To find more information, look for "package discovery" on setuptools docs.

      hint: This usually indicates a problem with the package or the build environment.
