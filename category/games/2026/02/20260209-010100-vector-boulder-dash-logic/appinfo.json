  "description": "Navigate a hazardous cave to collect diamonds while avoiding falling rocks.",
  "rationale": "This game focuses on spatial reasoning and gravity-based physics puzzles. It targets players who enjoy retro arcade logic games and provides an excellent environment for RL agents to learn pathfinding under environmental constraints.",
  "details": "The game consists of a 2D grid filled with dirt, rocks, and diamonds. The player (the digger) moves through the grid, removing dirt to create paths. Rules: 1. Gravity affects rocks and diamonds; they fall if there is empty space or a rounded object below them. 2. A falling rock will crush the player, ending the game. 3. Players can push rocks horizontally if there is empty space behind the rock. 4. Collecting a specific number of diamonds opens the exit door. 5. Enemies move in predictable patterns and must be avoided or crushed by falling rocks for extra points.",

  "how_to_play": "Goal: Collect all diamonds and reach the exit. Controls: Use Arrow Keys to move the player. Scoring: +10 points per diamond, +50 points for reaching the exit. Game Over: Player is hit by a rock or enemy. RL Strategy: Maximize reward by finding the shortest path to diamonds while predicting rock fall trajectories.",
