  "description": "Engage in a classic tactical naval warfare game against a smart AI opponent.",
  "rationale": "Battleship is a timeless strategic puzzle that requires logical deduction and probability estimation. This version provides a clean, vector-based interface for casual players and a structured environment for reinforcement learning agents to master search-and-destroy tactics.",
  "details": "The game is played on a 10x10 grid. Each player has a fleet of 5 ships: Carrier (5), Battleship (4), Destroyer (3), Submarine (3), and Patrol Boat (2). The game proceeds in rounds. In each round, the player chooses a coordinate to fire upon. If a ship occupies that coordinate, it is a hit; otherwise, it is a miss. A ship is sunk when all its squares are hit. The objective is to sink the entire enemy fleet before they sink yours. The UI uses monochromatic vector graphics for high visibility and clear game state representation.",

  "how_to_play": "Score increases for every successful hit (+10) and significantly for sinking a ship (+50). Use the mouse to click on the 10x10 enemy grid to select coordinates. In RL mode, agents send integer pairs (x, y) via stdin or API. The game ends when one side's total ship health (17 hits) reaches zero.",
