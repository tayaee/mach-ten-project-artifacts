# Binary Crossroad Traffic Control

A tense traffic control puzzle game where you manage traffic signals at an intersection to pass as many vehicles as possible without accidents.

## Description

Manage traffic signals at a cross-shaped intersection. Vehicles enter from top, bottom, left, and right directions at regular intervals. Click to toggle between vertical (top-bottom) and horizontal (left-right) green signals. Vehicles with red lights wait, while green light vehicles proceed. Game over if queues reach screen edge or vehicles collide in the intersection.
