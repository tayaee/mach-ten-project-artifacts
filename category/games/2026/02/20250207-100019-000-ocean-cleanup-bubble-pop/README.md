# Ocean Cleanup Bubble Pop

An addictive puzzle arcade game that cleans the ocean by trapping trash in bubbles.

## Description

Launch cleaning bubbles from the bottom of the screen to hit ocean trash items at the top. Each trash item (plastic bottles, cans, nets) has a colored border. Hit matching colored bubbles to the trash to purify it and score points. When trash reaches the bottom deadline, game over. Chain successful purifications for combo points, and hit golden bubbles for area-of-effect cleanup.

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari). Click or touch the screen to aim and shoot bubbles.
