# Rhythmic Tile Tap Classic

A simple and addictive rhythm game where you tap black tiles falling to the beat to score points.

## Description

Test your reflexes and rhythm sense in this classic tile-tapping rhythm game. Black tiles fall from the top of the screen in 4 lanes, and you must tap them exactly when they reach the judgment line at the bottom. The game gets progressively faster as your score increases.

## Target Audience

- Anyone who wants to test their reflexes and rhythm sense
- Players of all ages looking for an immersive game experience without complex controls
- Users seeking stress relief through short, focused gameplay sessions

## How it Works

1. The screen is divided into 4 vertical lanes
2. Black tiles fall from top to bottom in sync with the beat
3. Tap the lane when the tile reaches the judgment line at the bottom
4. Missing a tile or tapping an empty lane instantly ends the game
5. Speed increases progressively as you score higher
6. Score is calculated based on the number of tiles successfully tapped

## How to Build

Built with HTML5 Canvas and Web Audio API using pure JavaScript. No external libraries required. The core logic (tile generation, collision detection, speed control) is implemented in vanilla JavaScript.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies: `uv sync`
2. Run the server: `uv run python main.py`
3. Open your browser to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
